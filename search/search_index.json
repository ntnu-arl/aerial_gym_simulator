The environments are built upon the underlying NVIDIA Isaac Gym simulator. We offer aerial robot models for standard planar quadrotor platforms, as well as fully-actuated platforms and multirotors with arbitrary configurations. These configurations are supported with low-level and high-level geometric controllers that reside on the GPU and provide parallelization for the simultaneous control of thousands of multirotors.</p> <p>This is the second release of the simulator and includes a variety of new features and improvements. Task definition and environment configuration allow for fine-grained customization of all the environment entities without having to deal with large monolithic environment files. A custom rendering framework allows obtaining depth, and segmentation images at high speeds and can be used to simulate custom sensors such as LiDARs with varying properties. The simulator is open-source and is released under the BSD-3-Clause License.</p> <p>Aerial Gym Simulator allows you to train state-based control policies in under a minute,</p> <p></p> <p>And train vision-based navigation policies in under an hour:</p> <p></p> <p>Equipped with GPU-accelerated and customizable ray-casting based LiDAR and Camera sensors with depth and segmentation capabilities:</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"#features","title":"Features","text":"<ul> <li> Modular and Extendable Design   allowing users to easily create custom environments, robots, sensors, tasks, and controllers, and changing parameters programmatically on-the-fly by modifying the Simulation Components. </li> <li> Rewritten from the Ground-Up   to offer very high control over each of the simulation components and capability to extensively customize the simulator to your needs. </li> <li> High-Fidelity Physics Engine   leveraging NVIDIA Isaac Gym, which provides a high-fidelity physics engine for simulating multirotor platforms, with the possibility of adding support for custom physics engine backends and rendering pipelines. </li> <li> Parallelized Geometric Controllers   that reside on the GPU and provide parallelization for the simultaneous control of thousands of multirotor vehicles. </li> <li> Custom Rendering Framework   (based on NVIDIA Warp) used to design custom sensors and perform parallelized kernel-based operations. </li> <li> Modular and Extendable   allowing users to easily create custom environments, robots, sensors, tasks, and controllers. </li> <li> RL-based control and navigation policies   of your choice can be added for robot learning tasks.

In this above class, the <code>step(...)</code> function first translates the commands from the RL agent to a control command for the specific robot platform by transforming the action input. Subsequently this is commanded to the robot and the environment is stepped. Finally, a reward is computed for the new state and truncations and terminations are determined and the final tuple is returned for use by the RL framework. Similarly, for trajectory tracking, only the reward function and observation needs to be changed to train the RL algorithm without making any changes to the asset, robots or the environment.</p> <p>To add your own custom tasks please refer to the section on customizing the simulator.</p> Difference between Environment and Task <p>A lot of different simulator implementations interchange the terminologies. In our case, we view the environment as the components that define the robot, it's physics surroundings, i.e., the assets near the robot, the parameters of the physics engine that detemine how the various entities in the simulation world interact with one another, and how sensors perceive the data via the sensor parameters.</p> <p>The task on the other hand is an interpretation of the simulation world and the information provided by / collected from it to reach a particular goal that is desired by the user. The same environment can be used to train multiple tasks and the tasks can be changed without changing an environment definition.</p> <p>For example, an empty environment with a quadrotor can be used to train a position setpoint task, or a trajectory tracking task. An environment with a set of obstacles can be used to train a policy that can either navigate through the obstacles or perch on a specific asset in the environment. The task is the interpretation of the environment data for the RL algorithm to learn the desired behavior.</p> <p>To relate it with a familiar environment from the OpenAI Gym suite of tasks, an \"environment\" in our case could refer to a CartPole world with its associated dynamics, however a \"task\" in our case would allow the same cartpole to be controlled to balance the pole upright, or to keep swinging the pole at a given angular rate or to have the endpoint of the pole at a given location in the environment. All of which require different formulation of rewards and observations for the RL algorithm to learn the desired behavior.</p>"},{"location":"4_simulation_components/#robots","title":"Robots","text":"<p>Robots can be specified and configured independently of the sensors and the environment using a robot registry.

Please stay tuned for updates on this.</p> <p>How can I use the Isaac Gym Simulator with my custom robot?</p> <p>The Isaac Gym Simulator is designed to be modular and flexible, allowing users to easily integrate their custom robots. You can refer to the Custom Robot Integration section of the documentation for detailed instructions on how to integrate your custom robot with the Isaac Gym Simulator.</p> <p>How can I randomize the pose of the sensor on the robot</p> <p>The pose of the sensor can be randomized by enabling the <code>randomize_placement</code> flag in the sensor configuration file. This is however only applicable to Warp rendering pipeline and is very slow with the Isaac Gym's native rendering pipeline as it requires the user to loop through each sensor instance. By default the sensor position is randomized at each reset of the environment, however you can randomize at each timestep if you like with little overhead.</p> <p>How can I change the randomize the pose at which the robot spawns</p> <p>This can be set using the <code>min_init_state</code> and the <code>max_init_state</code> parameters in the robot configuration file. The starting pose of the robot is randomized at each reset of the environment by default. Based on the current structure, the position is a ratio of the environment bounds, and the orientation can be defined by minimum and maximum roll, pitch and yaw values.</p> <p>Difference between Environment and Task</p> <p>A lot of different simulator implementations interchange the terminologies. In our case, we view the environment as the components that define the robot, it's physics surroundings, i.e., the assets near the robot, the parameters of the physics engine that detemine how the various entities in the simulation world interact with one another, and how sensors perceive the data via the sensor parameters.</p> <p>The task on the other hand is an interpretation of the simulation world and the information provided by / collected from it to reach a particular goal that is deired by the user. The same environment can be used to train multiple tasks and the tasks can be changed without changing an environment definition.</p> <p>For example, an empty environment with a quadrotor can be used to train a position setpoint task, or a trajectory tracking task. An environment with a set of obstacles can be used to train a policy that can either navigate through the obstacles or perch on a specific asset in the environment. The task is the interpretation of the environment data for the RL algorithm to learn the desired behavior.</p> <p>To relate it with a familiar environment from the OpenAI Gym suite of tasks, an \"environment\" in our case could refer to a CartPole world with the dynamics of the CartPole, however a \"task\" in our case would allow the same cartpole to be controlled to balance the pole upright, or to keep swinging the pole at a given angular rate or to have the endpoint of the pole at a given location in the environment. All of which require different formulation of rewards and observations for the RL algorithm to learn the desired behavior.</p>"},{"location":"7_FAQ_and_troubleshooting/#troubleshooting","title":"Troubleshooting","text":"<p>My Isaac Gym viewer window does not show anything or is blank</p> <p>This can be because of a discrepancy in the version of your NVIDIA drivers.
